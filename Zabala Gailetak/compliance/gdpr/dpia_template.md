### 1.1 Version History

| Version | Date | Author | Changes |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| 1.0 | 2026-01-08 | DPO | Initial DPIA template creation |

### 1.2 Purpose

This Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) template is used to identify and minimize data protection risks when implementing new processing activities or significantly changing existing ones. DPIAs are required under GDPR Article 35 when processing is "likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons."

### 1.3 When is a DPIA Required?

**DPIA is MANDATORY when processing involves:**
1. **Systematic and extensive automated processing** including profiling with legal or similarly significant effects
2. **Large-scale processing of special category data** (Article 9) or personal data relating to criminal convictions (Article 10)
3. **Systematic monitoring of publicly accessible areas on a large scale** (e.g., extensive CCTV)

**DPIA is RECOMMENDED when processing involves (WP29/EDPB criteria):**
- Evaluation or scoring (credit scoring, fraud detection, profiling)
- Automated decision-making with legal or significant effects
- Systematic monitoring
- Sensitive data or highly personal data (location, health, financial)
- Large-scale processing (consider number of data subjects, volume, duration, geographical scope)
- Matching or combining datasets
- Data concerning vulnerable data subjects (children, employees, patients, elderly)
- Innovative use or application of technological or organizational solutions
- Processing that prevents data subjects from exercising rights or using services
