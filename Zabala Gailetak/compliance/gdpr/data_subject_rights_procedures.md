4. Do not fulfill request until identity confirmed
5. If data subject fails to verify within 30 days, close request with notification

### 3.6 Response Delivery

**Format:**
- Same medium as request (email response to email request, letter to postal request)

## 6. Right to Erasure / "Right to be Forgotten" (Article 17)

### 6.1 When Erasure is Required

Data subject can request erasure when:
1. Data no longer necessary for original purpose
2. Data subject withdraws consent (and no other legal basis exists)
3. Data subject objects and no overriding legitimate grounds exist
4. Data processed unlawfully
5. Legal obligation requires erasure
6. Data collected from child for online services (special protection)

### 6.2 Exceptions (When Erasure Cannot Be Granted)

Must refuse erasure if processing is necessary for:
1. **Freedom of expression and information**
2. **Legal obligation** (e.g., tax records, accounting)
3. **Public health** in the public interest
4. **Archiving, research, statistics** in the public interest
5. **Legal claims** (establishing, exercising, or defending legal claims)

### 6.3 Processing Erasure Requests

**Step 1: Assess Eligibility**

- Review request against Article 17 grounds
- Check for exceptions that apply
- Consider retention obligations (tax, accounting, contracts)

**Decision Matrix:**

| Data Category | Typical Decision | Reason |
|---------------|------------------|--------|
| Marketing data (consent-based) | **GRANT** | Consent withdrawn, no other legal basis |
| Transaction records < 7 years | **REFUSE** | Legal obligation (Spanish tax/accounting law) |
| Employee records < limitation period | **REFUSE** | Legal claims (potential employment disputes) |
| Website browsing history | **GRANT** | No longer necessary, no legal obligation |
| Customer account (no recent orders) | **GRANT** (with exceptions) | No longer necessary; retain financial records per legal obligation |

**Step 2: If Erasure Granted**

**Systems to Erase From:**
- Production databases
- Marketing platforms
- Email lists
- CRM systems
- Analytics platforms
- Log files (where feasible)
- Backup systems (mark for deletion at next backup cycle; explain this to data subject)

**Erasure Methods:**
- **Hard Delete:** Permanently remove data (preferred)
- **Pseudonymization:** If hard delete not technically feasible (explain to data subject)
- **Archival Separation:** If legal obligation requires retention (isolate data, restrict access)

**Erasure Verification:**
- Run search across all systems to confirm deletion
- Document deletion date and method
- Retain erasure request documentation (but not the personal data itself)

**Step 3: Notify Third Parties**

If data was disclosed to third parties:
- Notify all recipients of erasure request
- Request they also erase the data
- Document notifications

**Step 4: Respond to Data Subject**

**Erasure Granted Template:**

```

Your erasure request is now complete. Your account has been closed and you will not receive further communications from us.

### 6.4 Special Considerations

**Deceased Persons:**
- GDPR doesn't apply to deceased persons
- Spanish LOPDGDD Article 3 provides some rights to relatives
- Assess requests from family members case-by-case with legal counsel

**Children's Data:**
- Enhanced scrutiny for erasure requests related to data collected from children
- Lower threshold for granting erasure

---

## 7. Right to Restriction of Processing (Article 18)

### 7.1 When Restriction Can Be Requested

Data subject can request restriction when:
1. **Accuracy is contested** (restrict while verifying accuracy)
2. **Processing is unlawful** (data subject prefers restriction over erasure)
3. **No longer needed by controller** but data subject needs it for legal claims
4. **Objection pending** (restrict while verifying if legitimate grounds override objection)

### 7.2 What Restriction Means

When processing is restricted:
- **Can:** Store the data
- **Can:** Process with data subject consent
- **Can:** Process for legal claims
- **Can:** Process to protect rights of another person or public interest
- **Cannot:** Use for any other purpose (no marketing, no analytics, no sharing with third parties)

### 7.3 Processing Restriction Requests

**Step 1: Assess Request**

- Identify which ground applies
- Determine scope of restriction
- Set timeline for resolution (e.g., accuracy verification period)

**Step 2: Implement Restriction**

**Technical Methods:**
- Flag data as "restricted" in database
- Move data to separate restricted storage
- Implement access controls preventing use
- Document restriction date and reason

**Systems to Restrict:**
- All systems processing the restricted data
- Third-party systems (notify processors)

**Step 3: Notify Third Parties**

If data was disclosed to third parties:
- Notify all recipients of restriction
- Request they also restrict processing

**Step 4: Respond to Data Subject**

**Restriction Granted Template:**

```

- **Necessity:** Is processing necessary for our interest?
- **Alternatives:** Could we achieve purpose another way?
- **Impact:** What is impact on data subject if we continue?

**Step 2: Decision**

**If Objection Granted (Our Interests Do Not Override):**
- Stop processing for that purpose
- May continue processing for other purposes with different legal basis
- Respond to data subject

**If Objection Refused (Our Interests Override):**
- Provide detailed justification
- Explain compelling legitimate grounds
- Respond to data subject

**General Objection Granted Template:**

```
Dear [Data Subject Name],

Re: Objection to Processing - Reference: DSR-[YYYY]-[NNN]

Thank you for your objection dated [Date] to processing of your personal data.

We have reviewed your objection and the particular circumstances you described. After careful consideration, we have decided to grant your objection.

**Processing Stopped:**
We have stopped processing your data for [purpose - e.g., "behavioral analytics and personalization"].

**Processing Continued:**
We will continue to process your data where required for:
- [E.g., "Order fulfillment (legal basis: contract performance)"]
- [E.g., "Accounting records (legal basis: legal obligation)"]

If you have any questions, please contact us at dpo@zabalagailetak.com.

**General Objection Refused Template:**

```
Dear [Data Subject Name],

Re: Objection to Processing - Reference: DSR-[YYYY]-[NNN]

Thank you for your objection dated [Date] to processing of your personal data for [purpose].

We have carefully reviewed your objection and the particular circumstances you described. After balancing your interests against our legitimate grounds, we have determined that we must continue processing for the following compelling reasons:

**Compelling Legitimate Grounds:**
[Provide detailed, specific justification. Example:
"We process your IP address and transaction details for fraud prevention and security purposes. This processing is necessary to:
- Protect our business and other customers from fraudulent transactions
- Comply with legal obligations to prevent money laundering
- Detect and prevent security threats

Ceasing this processing would expose our business and other customers to significant risk. The processing is narrowly scoped to security purposes, uses automated systems with limited human access, and does not result in profiling or decisions affecting you.

While we understand your privacy concerns, we believe the compelling need to prevent fraud and ensure security overrides your objection in this particular case."]

**Your Rights:**
You have the right to:
- Lodge a complaint with AEPD at www.aepd.es or +34 901 100 099
- Seek judicial remedy

If you have additional information or concerns, please contact us at dpo@zabalagailetak.com.
